        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin making the Macher Jhol Recipe, wash and clean fish pieces twice with water. Ensure they are properly cleaned.</li>
            <li>Add salt and turmeric powder to the cleaned fish pieces. Marinate it and set aside.</li>
            <li>Leave the fish for marination for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>In a heavy bottomed pan, add the required oil and heat over medium heat. Fry the fish pieces and fry until they turn lightly brown. The fish pieces should be half cooked.</li>
            <li>In the medium sized wok/kadhai, add the remaining oil and heat over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds and bay leaf. Let it crackle.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become mushy. To the mushy tomatoes, add red chilli powder, coriander powder and ginger garlic paste.</li>
            <li>Cook until the raw smell goes off and the spice powders are absorbed by the tomatoes. Add water as per your required consistency and bring it to boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water starts boiling, add the fried fish pieces and cook them over low flame.</li>
            <li>Slit the green chillies and add them to the curry. Once the fishes are cooked completely and the curry reaches required consistency, season it with salt and switch off the flame</li>
            <li>Ensure the curry is cooked over medium flame once the fish pieces are added. If fish is overcooked, it might dissolve in the curry.</li>
            <li>Garnish with coriander leaves and serve warmly. Prepare Macher Jhol and serve it along with Steamed Rice and Begun Bhaja for your everyday meals.</li>
